#Implementation of a Python script for archiving files on a Linux system:


A Python script should be implemented which moves all files from all members of a group to an archive folder. The name of the group should be a parameter of the program.

The program should be robust, e.g. with respect to multiple invocations in short time. The events and results should be available in a log file.

The program should be installable as a Debian package and should be made available for download. The Debian package does not have to be built, the sources are sufficient.
